Project Structure:
The project is composed by the following files
- grid_generator.m
The goal of this module is to define the cells layout and to generate the 'Deployment spots' (points where the beam will be directed)
and 'Measure spots' (points that measure the power density and the electric field)
- simulator_5GPencil.m
This module is the core of the project that is the simulator. 
The simulator has 4 goals: 
1. synthesizing the beams, aimed at the deployment spots defined in the previous module; 
2. generating each user within a circular area of diameter epsilon (localization uncertainty) inside each deployment spot;
3. computing SINR and throughput over users and deployment spots
4. computing the contribution in terms of electromagnetic field over the serving cell, which is the central one surrounded by 6 cells.


Execution:
1. Run grid_generator.m with measure=1;
Note: default radius is set to 100 meters, and it represents the radius of the cell, you can change it by changing r variable.
In this step you're generating the measurement spots in the whole central cell. In order to limit the computational complexity, the plots are deactivated by default, but you can activate them by imposing plot_on=1;
Note: whenever you change cell radius you have to repeat step 1. 
2. Run grid_generator.m with measure=0;
Now you generate the deployment spot. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the end of these steps 4 files are generated (needed for next step):
a. layout.mat
contains the basic configuration: gNBs, cells and sectors
b. useful_spot.mat
contains all points
c. measure.mat
containing all measurement spots
d. deploy.mat
containing all deploy spots
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Run simulator_5GPencil.m
Default setting:
measure_on=1; %1 to enable computation of emf, 0 to turn off
fixed_emf = 0; %1 to enable computation of emf when no beamforming is used
plot_on=0; %1 to enable plot, 0 to disable
NLOS_on=1; %1 for NLOS, 0 for LOS
int_intrasec=1; %1 to consider intrasector interference, 0 to disable
fig_style=1; %to enable plot of user tolerance areas
accuracy=2; %diameter (m) of area around deploy spot in which the UE is deployed
Note: 
In lines 178 and 179 you can choose to set az3dB equal to 65째 or 90째 respectively and in lines 209 and 210 you can choose to set el3dB equal to 65째 or 7째 respectively.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the end of these step files are generated (metrics to be evaluated):
a. deploy_comp.mat 
all the deployment spots with their infos
b. user_comp.mat 
all the users with their infos
c. fixed_emf_data.mat
d. angle_3dB 
the azimuth and elevation 3dB angles for each beams of each sector
e. emf_data.mat 
all measure spots with their infos

Moreover there is a directory "Data" in which the following files will be saved:
emf*accuracy*.mat
(for example: emf2.mat or emf16.mat)
This file contains the avg emf, the emf confidence interval, and the emf

Note for macOS users:
-all backslashes should be changed with forward slashes, because of Linux-friendly notation-
For example line 649 should be changed as follows:
fname=join(['Data/emf',num2str(accuracy),'.mat']);
